# 🌍🚀 Seismic Detection Across the Solar System 🌕🔴

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting seismic events such as **moonquakes** 🌕 and **marsquakes** 🔴 using seismic data from lunar and Martian environments. By implementing seismic analysis techniques and machine learning models, the project aims to classify seismic events to better understand planetary tectonics, surface dynamics, and internal structures.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Seismic Event Detection**: The project uses the STA/LTA (Short-Time Average/Long-Time Average) algorithm to detect potential seismic events from the data.
- **Classification**: Machine learning models 🧠 (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks) are trained to classify seismic events based on features extracted from the detected events.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score** are used to evaluate model performance against a ground truth dataset.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🚀 Enhance the accuracy of seismic event detection on the **Moon** 🌕 and **Mars** 🔴.
- 🧑‍🔬 Contribute to planetary science by improving our understanding of planetary tectonics.
- 🛰️ Support space exploration efforts by providing insights into planetary surface dynamics.

## 🛠️ Benefits

- **Scientific Research**: Understanding seismic activity can help in exploring the internal structure of planets and moons.
- **Exploration**: Seismic data can reveal potential hazards or resources, aiding future space missions 🌌.
- **Technology Development**: The project develops adaptable seismic event detection algorithms for various planetary environments.
